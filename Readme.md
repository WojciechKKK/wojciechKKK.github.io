### General info
A game based on guessing words.
It contains four categories of difficulties: colors, names, cities (data read from the local js file)
and categories of the state (data read from RestAPI - https://restcountries.eu/).
We have a hidden word on the board. Each letter is replaced by '_'.
The player chooses any letter if it is in the word you guessed it in the password, all instances of this literary will be revealed, otherwise the gallows will be created.
In each password, we can commit a maximum of 10 errors and use hints.
